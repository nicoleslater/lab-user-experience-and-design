## Lab Setup

Included is a functional web app:

However, there have been some questionable UX/UI choices added to the app. Your job will be to add HTML and CSS to make this app easy and intuitive to understand and use.

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the `settings` tab on GitHub, then choose `Pages` from the menu. Configure the `Build and Deployment` to have a `Source` of `Deploy from a branch` and select the `main` branch for deployment. Deployments can take a few minutes, so get started on the lab, and then be sure to check the deployment after you have made a few commits.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

## Instructions

Take some time to use the app and familiarize yourself with how it works. Note what was difficult or confusing.

Update the HTML to clarify the content of the app.

Update the CSS to improve the user experience.

> **Note**: You may delete the entire CSS content and start from scratch or edit what is there.
